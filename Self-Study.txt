Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
A mobile-first design starts at the smaller screen size and changes as the screen size increases.
A mobile-first approach is better since it's easier to make a design larger in comparison to compressing a desktop design to a mobile design. 

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing makes web development faster since it reduces the amount of CSS code that you need to write.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
Nesting is my favorite part of preprocessing. It's a lot easier to keep your code organized and clean. I haven't had any issues with the preprocessing so far.
